There are dozens of static site generators, all of them try to do too much for my taste.

the first two lines are all you need to change, define the name of a template file
and the name of your content files.  The content files will need a leading
underscore, and once compiled this will be removed, so if you want the resulting
file to be foo.html, your content file needs to be _foo.html

Running build.rb will check the current dir and all subdirs for content files
and will build a live file with the template for each one it finds.

The template file will need to contain: {content} where the content
should go.
